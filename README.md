# C_Programming

This repository contains all programs implementation in **C language** from *B.tech Programming syllabus*.
Most of the programms from **Let Us c** and **C in Depth** books.

## Running the C programms
### On Windows:

1. On windows download the `Devcpp` software.
2. Now open the folder in `Devcpp` software and open the program which you want to run
3. Click on the compile button. (It will compile the program)
4. Click on the run button to execute the program.
5. You can directly compile and run program from commandline in windows. (same as linux)

### On Linux
1.  Open the folder in any texteditor(Vscode, jeany, etc.)
2. Open terminal
3. Compile the program
```bash
$ gcc program_name.c -o program_name

# if your program contains any mathematic function ('math.h')
# then link math library as
$ gcc -lm program_name.c -o program_name
```
4. run the program
```
$ ./program_name
```
### On Mac
  Same as windows or linux
